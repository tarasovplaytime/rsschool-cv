const magic_number = 3.3312;
while (true) {
    const user_input = parseFloat(prompt("Enter a guess: "));
    if (user_input === magic_number) {
        console.log("Correct!");
        break;
    } else if (user_input > magic_number) {
        console.log("Too high!");
    } else if (user_input < magic_number) {
        console.log("Too low!");
    }
}
```

# Experience
Despite the large number of websites created, one of the most ambitious projects is the creation of a design, as well as the coding of my personal portfolio site. I also took 2 real orders to create a website, which I successfully coped with.
